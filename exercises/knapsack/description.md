Given a set of items, each with a weight, w and a value, v, determine the number of each item to include in a collection so that the total weight is less than or equal to a given limit and the total value is as large as possible

Knapsack Max weight: W = 10 
Total items: N = 4
Values of items: v[] = {10, 40, 30, 50}
Weight of items: w[] = {5, 4, 6, 3}
