In this exercise, lets try to solve a classic problem.

Bob is a thief. After months of planning, he 
finally manages to crack the security systems of a 
high-class apartment. In front of him are many 
items, each with a value (v) and weight (w). Bob of
course wants to maximize the total value he can 
get; he would of course take all the items if he
could. However, to his horror, he realized that the 
knapsack he carried with him can only hold so much weight(W).

Given a knapsack of weight limit (W), can you help Bob 
determine the maximum value he can get from the 
items in the house? Note, you can take only one of 
each item. 

All values given will be strictly positive integers.
Items will be represented as a list of pairs [wi, vi] where the first element (wi) is the weight of the ith item and vi is the value for that item.

For example:

Items: [[5, 10], [4, 40], [6, 30], [4, 50]]
Knapsack Limit: 10


For the above, item 1 has weight 5 and value 10, items 2 has weight 4 and value 40, and so on...

Bob should take item 2 and 4 to maximize his value which in this case is 90. He cannot get more than 90 as his knapsack has a weight limit of 10
